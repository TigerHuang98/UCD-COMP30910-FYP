This repository contains the result of the experiments conducted in the project, and the scripts used to generate the Plots in the final report.

The directory ./data/ contains the experiment results for eight sub-experiments, the structure of sub-experiment folder name is  <application><implementation><server>, where application={dgemm|fft}, implementation={IntelMKL|OpenBLAS|FFTW}, server={server1|server2}
In these sub-experiment folders, there are two types of folder, the first type is the ..../merged_result/ , which contains the result after being cleaned, and act as the base of plot drawing.
The other type is the folders started with date, these folders contains the raw experiment data generated on that day.

The directory ./plots/ contains all the plots generated by the scripts, the structure of plot's name is ./plots/<application>/<implementation>/<server>/N<problem_size>.png

The directory ./Recalculate/ contains the scripts used in the data cleaning process.

The ./requirements.txt file contains the dependencies for the plot-drawing scripts,  the direct dependencies for those scripts are matplotlib and NumPy.

The DrawPlotCore.py contains the common parts of the plot drawing scripts, but not intended to be a stand-alone script.

The DrawPlot<sub-experiment name>.py are scripts that actually used to generate the plots.
